# Grocery-Inventory-Tracking-App
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project is for a grocery store that reads the daily purchases for a day and sorts the data and outputs the frequency each item is bought in a day. This is useful for the store so that they can sort the produce section and put the items that are most bought in the front. 


What did you do particularly well?
I implemeted the map feature to sort the data. this made it easier and more effecient to sort data and output it. 


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could make my code more secure by adding more private data memebers and assigning another object to the private data to make it more secure. And if my code is running slowly i can remove some unnessacry code and rewrite it, but my code is working at a normal speed. 


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
A challanging part of the project was getting the input file to open in eclipse. Eclipse has been giving me problems but i was able to trouble shoot it and solve the issue. I used youtube tutorials to trouble shoot and fix the issue. 


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Ive learned how to use the Map feature and hopefully i can apply this to future projects that will require me to sort data.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I created a google docs that includes my thought process for creating the code and explanations for some sections of the code along with screenshots.
